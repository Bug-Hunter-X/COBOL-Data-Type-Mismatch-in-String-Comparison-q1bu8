This example demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic error in COBOL. It highlights the importance of careful data type handling, especially when comparing numeric fields with string literals. The error arises when the WS-CUSTOMER-NAME field is inadvertently treated as numeric within a string comparison operation. The solution showcases the correction of the data type handling and the importance of checking all possible data types during comparison operations.
